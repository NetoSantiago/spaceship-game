# spaceship-game
A spaceship game made with C++ and Glut/OpenGL.

I first of all, i'm learning glut and openGL, so dont expect a awesome spaceship game.. it's VEEERY simple.

When you die, you can right click and choose play, to play again.

The game is not counting points yet, and it have only one type of enemy.

In the future the points count and more types of enemies will be added.
